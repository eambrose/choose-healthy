     <h2 align = 'center'> While investigating the impact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert">food deserts</a> on community health, we noticed that food access isn't the most important contributor to healthy eating. Here's the story:</h2>
     
          <br><br>
     <h3 align='center'> The number of stores and restaurants in a community vary with poverty level </h3>

  <div class='bokeh' align='center'>
  {{div1|safe}}
  </div>
     <br><br><br> <br> <br>
     <h3 align = 'center'> and obesity and diabetes correlate with poverty.</h3>
  <div class='bokeh' align='center'>
  {{div0|safe}}
     </div>

     <br><br><br> <br> <br>
     <h3 align='center'> This health discrepancy could be due to lower access to healthy food in poorer communities, </h3>
     <h3 align='center'>but food access and grocery store availability are not good predictors of community obesity levels</h3>
  <div class='bokeh' align='center'>
   {{div2|safe}}
  </div>
     <br><br><br> <br> <br>
     
     <h3 align='center'>In communities with high obesity, more people are opting for fast food meals.

  </div>
     <br><br><br> <br> <br>
     <h3 align='center'>Food access and food availability are not as important as the choice that we make about what food to eat.
         Usually these choices are based on time and convenience. </h3>
